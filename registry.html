        We understand that it's important to you to express your well wishes,
        and we welcome them! Some of you may want to give us gifts. The
        sentiment is appreciated; however, we have more than enough for our own
        lives, and it would give us great joy if you donated to one of the
        following organizations instead:

      <h4>
        <a href="http://www.thebronxfreedomfund.org/">The Bronx Freedom Fund</a> (<a href="https://secure.thebronxfreedomfund.org/page/contribute/donate">Donate</a>)
      </h4>

        These folks do great work helping people pay bail so they can get back
        to their jobs and families while awaiting trial.
