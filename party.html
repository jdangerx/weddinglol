      <h3>Party</h3>
      Here's the formidable wedding party we've assembled!

      <h4>Bridespeople</h4>
        <strong>Maria</strong> is the best woman. We have known each
        other since before we could speak in full sentences.
      <p>
        <strong>AJ</strong> is a good man. He has never read Harry
        Potter before.
      <p>
        <strong>Ashley</strong> is a good woman. She likes yams, free
        food, and living in England sometimes.
      <p>
        <strong>Nick</strong> is a good man. I was a good man for him,
        too. We are just two very good people, I guess.
      <p>
        <strong>Sonia</strong> is a good woman. She is perfect in every
        way except that her favorite color is orange.
      <p>

      <h4>Groomspeople</h4>
        <strong>James</strong> is the best man. He's so good. He's so
        good. He's so good. He's so good.
      <p>
        <strong>Chace</strong> is a good man. We spent a delirious evening
        finding the best way to throw marshmallows with common kitchen
        implements.
      <p>
        <strong>Jordan</strong> is a good man. Eight years ago, we
        both wondered what a milkshake with all the ice cream flavors
        and add-ons would taste like.
      <p>
        <strong>Josh</strong> is a good man. One late night, after
        completing some physics homework, we went to the convenience
        store and bought Oscar-Meyer weiners to fence with.
      <p>
        <strong>Rachel</strong> is a good woman. In college, she would
        impersonate me in online Tetris so she could crush other people
        at my level, like an NFL player playing in a local flag
        football league.
